# Blog By Glitchy

This is a simple project to learn and to start blogging stuff or things I know, I am trying to make this using go htmx and tailwind, ideally make use of markdown files to automatically generate content for the blog.

This project is a single binary blog solution that ideally will have a config to set the directory for markdown files which can be used as content.

## Development setup

Get started with running the project

```bash
go run . # This is to get started with building the go binary and start
```

To get started, setup tailwind cli tool in a new terminal (Optional)

```bash
# To install tailwind cli tool to generate the classes
npm install

# Generate the tailwind file and watch for updates
npx @tailwindcss/cli -o ./public/tailwind.css --watch
```
